# Visual Accessibility Assistant for People with Visual Impairments

An AI-powered assistant that helps visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings using computer vision, speech recognition, and large language models.

## Overview

This project is designed to make everyday navigation easier for people with visual impairments.
The assistant combines object detection, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and a large language model (LLM) to provide real-time guidance about the environment.

Users can:

- Ask questions about their surroundings using voice.
- Get intelligent, context-aware answers about obstacles, people, and objects.
- Hear the response instantly via audio output.   

## System Flow

1. User Input: Voice or image (camera capture).
2. Speech-to-Text (STT): Converts spoken question into text.
3. Object Detection: Identifies objects in the scene using YOLOv8.
4. LLM + Knowledge Base: Answers user’s question with reasoning.
5. Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts answer into speech for the user.

## Features

- Real-time object detection with YOLOv8.
- Speech recognition for hands-free interaction.
- Conversational responses using LLaMA (via Groq API).
- Voice output for accessibility.
- Modular design (each component can be improved separately).

## Tech Stack  

| Component         | Tool / Library                          |  
|------------------|------------------------------------------|  
| Object Detection | YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)                     |  
| LLM              | LLaMA 3.1 (via Groq API)                 |  
| Speech-to-Text   | OpenAI Whisper / Google Speech API        |  
| Text-to-Speech   | gTTS / pyttsx3                           |  
| Backend          | Flask / FastAPI                          |  
| Frontend         | Tkinter     |  

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minsett7/Visual-Accessibility-Assistant-for-People-with-Visual-Impairments.git
cd Visual-Accessibility-Assistant-for-People-with-Visual-Impairments
```

2. Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

- Create Groq account and add you Groq key in ask_groq.py.
- Start the app.
- Press the voice button to ask a question (e.g., “What’s in front of me?”).
- The system captures the camera feed, analyzes the scene, and answers.
- Response is spoken back to the user.

## Advantages

- Lightweight and modular.
- Uses open-source models (LLaMA, YOLO).
- Accessible via voice-only interaction.

## Limitations

- Needs stable internet for Groq API calls.
- Object detection accuracy depends on YOLOv8 training.
- Limited real-world testing so far.

## Future Work

- Add OCR for reading signs/text.
- Support GPS-based navigation.
- Improve edge deployment (offline use).
- Enhance multilingual support.
